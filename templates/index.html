            <h1>ABOUT aTS%</h1>
            <p>Adjusted True Shooting % (aTS%) is an adapted and modified version
                   of the commonly used metric, True Shooting % (TS%). TS% by itself
                   is a good source of measuring efficiency, but it fails to account
                   for one thing that can sway a playerâ€™s efficiency based on their
                   situation: usage rate. In theory, the more shots a player takes,
                   and handles the ball, the less efficient they would become as there
                   is less variance due to hot shooting and there is also more fatigue
                   due to higher shot volume. aTS% rewards players who maintain elite
                   efficiency despite playing in high load situations, and does the
                   opposite for players in low volume situations. It incorporates usage
                   rate in its formula, creating a better and more advanced way of looking
                   at player efficiency. The formula for aTS% was derived through linear
                   regression amongst the two variables, TS% and Usage Rate. After finding
                   the correlation, a formula could be derived that incorporates that found
                   correlation with the TS% and usage rate of the player, as well as the
                   league average TS% and intercept. In the future, aTS% looks to incorporate
                   other factors such as spacing and teammate playmaking that can also have an
                   effect on efficiency. All in all, aTS% aims to be the future of efficiency
                   measuring statistics in the NBA.</p>

            <h1>ABOUT DEVELOPMENT</h1>
            <p>The development of aTS%, or Adjusted True Shooting Percentage, represents
                   a fascinating intersection of data science, web development, and basketball
                   analytics. This innovative statistic was brought to life through a multi-step
                   process that began with the extraction of data by scraping the NBA API using
                   Python. This versatile programming language proved instrumental in collecting
                   the necessary raw data for aTS%. Once obtained, this data underwent meticulous
                   transformation and analysis using the Pandas library. Linear regression, a
                   statistical technique, was employed to create the aTS% formula. This formula
                   dynamically incorporated various variables crucial to accurately assessing a
                   player's shooting performance. These variables, such as TS%, Usage Rate, league
                   average TS%, correlation coefficient, and intercept were seamlessly integrated
                   into a comprehensive DataFrame, a structured data representation, to facilitate
                   further analysis. The magic of aTS% truly came to life on the frontend of the
                   project, where HTML played a pivotal role. The DataFrame generated from the
                   Python calculations was elegantly displayed on the web interface using HTML
                   tables. This user-friendly presentation allowed basketball enthusiasts and
                   analysts alike to explore and dissect the aTS% data visually. The next step in
                   development is implementing data from other seasons, rather than just the
                   2022-23 league year. In essence, the development of aTS% showcases the power
                   of technology and data-driven insights in modern sports analysis.

            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>I am a dedicated student enrolled at the University of Washington, pursuing a
               degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering as a proud member of the Class
               of 2026. While my academic pursuits are centered around engineering, my true
               passion lies in the world of basketball. This dynamic intersection of technology
               and sports has fueled my enthusiasm for both analytics and computer science. My
               journey into the realm of basketball has been a multifaceted one. I've delved
               deep into the intricacies of the game, honing my expertise in not only the
               conventional facets but also the increasingly influential world of analytics.
               As a testament to this passion, I take immense pride in being the originator of
               the innovative statistic known as "aTS%," which redefines how we measure player
               efficiency by incorporating usage rate. Beyond my academic and statistical
               endeavors, I channel my basketball fervor into "HoopsLine," my very own Instagram
               page. Here, I combine my insights and creativity through graphic design to share
               my unique perspectives and opinions on the world of basketball. Through this
               platform, I aim to engage, educate, and inspire fellow basketball enthusiasts,
               fostering a community bound by our shared love for the game and its evolving
               landscape.</p>
