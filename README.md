# adjustedTrueShooting
This project utilizes an NBA stats API to scrape data with Python and uses pandas to do linear regression to find the correlation between usage rate and true shooting percentage. A formula is then derived using these variables for every player in the 2023 NBA season. This data is then displayed through an HTML/CSS frontend with the use of Flask. You can find this project on adjustedtrueshooting.com.
